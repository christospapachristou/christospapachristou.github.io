Hey! I am a graduate student, currently working at [IST Austria](https://ist.ac.at/en/home/) as a research intern. My interests lie in statistics, machine learning and data science. I earned my M.S. in Mathematics at the [University of Oxford in the UK](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/) and my B.S. in Mathematics at the [University of Patras in Greece](https://www.upatras.gr/en/).

Research interests describe.
